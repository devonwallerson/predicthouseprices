# predicthouseprices
Devon Wallerson 8/5/23

This project uses machine learning to predict the house prices in the New York City metro area. I used publically available datasets from St. Louis referring to national trends in Home Value, and then actual sales prices from Zillow.com.

During this project, I employ data cleaning techniques using Python, and then use SciKit Learn to employ a machine learning model to predict the prices of house value, while being cautious of accuracy.

Thank you for reading!
